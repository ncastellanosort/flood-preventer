* It is the final project of my architecture class, where we had to create a product to solve a problem in Colombia, I decided to choose the problem of flooding ðŸ’§.

Components used:
1. Ultrasound sensor HCSR04
2. Buzzer 
3. OLED screen
4. ESP32

* The project is connected with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). in order to have a visualization of the data with a difference of 5 seconds, also had the use of a docker container to assign a port precisely to open grafana, also the use of [MQTT](https://github.com/ncastellanosort/MQTT).
